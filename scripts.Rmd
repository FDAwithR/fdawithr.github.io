Some code relies on scripts or functions that is not shown in the book. These are listed here for completeness.

* [nhanes_fpcr.R](source/nhanes_fpcr.R) is used in Chapter 4 to implement functional principal components regression and format the results. 
* [pffrcoef_to_tf.R](source/pffrcoef_to_tf.R) is used in Chapter 5 to convert the output of `pffr()` to `tidyfun` objects. 
* [fosr_gam_res_to_tfd.R](source/fosr_gam_res_to_tfd.R) is used in Chapter 5 to convert the output of `gam()` to `tidyfun` objects. 
* [nhanes_boot_fui.R](source/nhanes_boot_fui.R) is used in Chapter 5 to implement fast, pointwise inference.
